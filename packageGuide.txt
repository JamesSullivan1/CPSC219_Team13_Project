HOW TO USE PACKAGING SYSTEM
-----

All .java files are to be held in a package within the 'src' tree. For example, /src/main/someFile.java.

Every file should contain a line that says 'package [insertPackageName];' on the first line, corresponding to whichever 
folder it is held in.

Classes in the same package can all access each other, however for classes to access other files you must do an import.

'import somePackage.someClass;' or 'import somePackage.*;' if you want all of the classes in a package.


Example: BoardTest.java
package test;
import main.*;




Eclipse will automatically take care of putting everything in the right place. However if you want to manually compile or run from the terminal, you will need to do some more advanced commands- get in touch if this is the case.
