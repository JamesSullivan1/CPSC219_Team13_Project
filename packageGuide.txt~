HOW TO USE PACKAGING SYSTEM
-----

All .java files are to be held in a package within the 'src' tree. For example, /src/main/someFile.java.

Every file should contain a line that says 'package [insertPackageName];' on the first line, corresponding to whichever 
folder it is held in.

Classes in the same package can all access each other, however for classes to access other files you must do an import.

'import somePackage.someClass;' or 'import somePackage.*;' if you want all of the classes in a package.


Example: BoardTest.java
package test;
import main.*;




A custom ANT build file was made to simplify compiling, however this requires the Apache Ant tools to use. Eclipse will take care of everything for you.

If you must compile from the terminal, you will need the 'ant' package, then use 'ant compile' to automatically compile everything (make sure you are in the CPSC219_Team13_Project directory!). Get in touch with me if you need help with this.
